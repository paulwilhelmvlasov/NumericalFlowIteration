## Instruction for use on the Cluster

1. Clone the project

2. Copy the include folder into `` ~/local/ ``

3. Add the following code to either your ``.bashrc`` or ``.zshrc``:

```
module unload intel
module unload intelmpi
module load cuda/11.6
module load gcc/11
module load openmpi/4.1.1

export C_INCLUDE_PATH=$MPI_INCLUDE:$CUDA_ROOT/include:$C_INCLUDE_PATH
export CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH=$MPI_INCLUDE:$CUDA_ROOT/include:$CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH
export LIBRARY_PATH=$MPI_LIBDIR:$CUDA_ROOT/lib64:$LIBRARY_PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$MPI_LIBDIR:$CUDA_ROOT/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
export C_INCLUDE_PATH=~/local/include:$C_INCLUDE_PATH
export CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH=~/local/include:$CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH
export LIBRARY_PATH=~/local/lib:$LIBRARY_PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=~/local/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```

4. Next execute the following commands in the main folder:

```
autoreconf --install
./configure
make
```

5. Lastly you can test the install:
```
mkdir build
cd build
../bin/test_dergeraet
```
